# Code 301 Day 3 Learning Journal  

Today we went over AJAX and JSON in detail. Basically JSON is a data storage for
browsers, and AJAX is the method of retrieving and using that data is what I got
from today. AJAX lets you update certain parts of the page, without having to
do a page reload.

The lab wasn't too bad, though I did forget to stringify the JSON which cost me
some time figuring out.
