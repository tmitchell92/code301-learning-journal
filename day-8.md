# Code 301 Day 8 Learning Journal  

Today we went over SQL and Node. Using node, we can set up a server.js file
which creates links our project to a server, which we can view on localhost.

The lab assignment had us review code that used SQL to create a table with
the articles data, from the json file. Install the dependecies the project needs,
make sure you're running the right port, and you can use a local server.
