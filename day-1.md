# Code 301 Day 1 Learning Journal  

Today in class, we went over mobile first, that is designing with the mobile screen  
size as the default, and as the screen width increases, the layout of the page  
will react responsively, to always look pleasing.

The lab went well enough, we through each TODO in reasonable times, the only one  
that gave us trouble was changing the hamburger size, until we realized it was
font-size, not img-size.
