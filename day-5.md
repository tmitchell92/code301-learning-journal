# Code 301 Day 3 Learning Journal  

Today in class, we did a code review of day 4 lab assignment, going over some code
that wasn't actually a part of the TODO's like the populate filters method.
We also did the workshop, creating a new page that lets you create an article
for the blog.

The lab yesterday went well, as handlebars made templating simple and easy to use
compared to Wednesday's lab. This allowed for more time to work on portfolio.
