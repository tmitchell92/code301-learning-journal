# Code 301 Day 3 Learning Journal  

Today in class, we went over jQuery, using it to call events to specific actions,
like click or change. In the previous class, learning how to use jQuery to manipulate
the DOM on the html was the main focus.

The lab assignments are structured in a way that you focus on little parts of a
big problem, which is helpful in approaching it. Both todays and yesterdays labs
were difficult, but I had to get help for today's lab on getting jQuery events
to work properly.
