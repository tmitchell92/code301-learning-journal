# Code 301 Day 11 Learning Journal  

Today we went over routes and controllers. Using controllers, you can switch between
data using different routes like '/about'.

The lab wasn't too difficult compared to Thursdays and Fridays lab, we had to add
routes and specify the specific event controllers, which simply hid the tab contents,
and then showed whatever they were supposed to show. One slip up was having a broken
route, which caused errors in the routes underneath that broken route. Once we removed
the extra, broken routes, everything worked.
